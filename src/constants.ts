Avoid any commentary outside the provided prompt structure, even titles. Provide only your output. Structure your answer the following way:
 1. Rationalization of picked answer as a list of bullet points written from first person perspective.
 2. Suggested answer out of list of possible answers.

Write the final choice on the last line, the last line should only include preferred choice and nothing else.

Be conservative and brief in rationalization and only mention points that really apply to the question. Less is more.
